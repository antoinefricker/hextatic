# Why using flat hexagonal tiles?

-   Allow slightly more room for text labels without crossing hexes
-   Seem to be better suited for 3D/isometric perspective; front high sprites won't obscure the center of the tile behind it, but just the edges
-   Feel more natural to look at on a map that is wider than it is tall which is the case on computer screens
-   As corollary; in a N by N grid, the horizontal layout results in a grid that is wider than it is tall
-   In bird's eye perspective, more walls will be visible
