# Why flat hesagonals

-   allows slightly more room for text labels without crossing hexes
-   feels more natural to look at on a map that is wider than it is tall
-   seems to be better suited for 3D/isometric perspective; front high sprites won't obscure the center of the tile behind it, but just the edges
-   for NxN grid, the horizontal layout results in a grid that is wider than it is tall, just like PC monitors
-   in bird's eye perspective, more walls will be visible
